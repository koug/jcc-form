# templates:forms

A minimalist library for creating reusable form components with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). Supports reactivity, validation, and submission (including complex workflows).

This package uses [aldeed:simple-schema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema) for field validation. 

See it in action [here](http://forms-example.meteor.com/).

#### Comparison with aldeed:autoform

- **[aldeed:autoform](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform)** automatically generates insert and update forms for your collections.
It is a large and rich package, tightly integrated with aldeed:simple-schema and aldeed:collection2.
- **templates:forms** only provides a thin framework for building reusable forms, form elements and form workflows.

#### Installation

```sh
$ meteor add templates:forms
```
